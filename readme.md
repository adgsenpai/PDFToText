# PDF2Txt

## This is a simple tool to convert PDF to text.

Works on Windows but not tested on Linux or Mac. You need to install Tessaract OCR first for these platforms and modify the code to make it work.

## Usage

- Install Python
- Install requirements
    - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Drop your `.pdf` file and run `python3 compliler.py`

Your output will be in `output.txt`
